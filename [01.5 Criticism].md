This is a rough draft that needs serious work to become a truly hilarious Seinfeld-esque episode. Here's the brutal, yet hopefully constructive, critique:

**The Problems:**

* **Lack of "Show, Don't Tell":**  The script heavily relies on telling us how the characters feel and what's happening instead of showing us through their actions and dialogue.  We hear Sam is miserable, but we don't see him act miserable. We are told David is manic, but we don't see his manic behavior. 
* **Uninspired Dialogue:**  The dialogue is flat and predictable. The jokes are mostly one-liners delivered with little comedic timing or setup.  "The warehouse of secrets," "secret stuff," and "a 'Radiant Performance'" are just examples of lines that lack wit and humor.
* **Weak Story Structure:**  The episode feels disjointed. There's no clear narrative thread driving the story forward. It's a series of random encounters and situations that lack connection and build-up. 
* **Characters Lack Depth:**  While you've changed the names, the characters feel like carbon copies of their Seinfeld counterparts. Sam is the neurotic one, Eddy is the sensible one, Jon is the kooky one, and David is the delusional one. They need unique quirks and motivations to stand out.
* **Missing the "Seinfeld-ness":** The episode is missing the signature Seinfeld humor: the absurdity of everyday life, the focus on trivial details, the self-absorbed nature of the characters, and the witty, observational dialogue. 

**How to Improve:**

1. **Show, Don't Tell:**  Let the characters' actions and interactions tell the story. Instead of "Sam is miserable," show him sighing dramatically, complaining about his work, and reacting negatively to any attempt at cheer. 
2. **Develop Dynamic Dialogue:** Write dialogue that is sharp, witty, and full of subtext.  Have the characters interrupt each other, contradict each other, and use clever wordplay.  
3. **Create a Compelling Story Arc:** Give the episode a central conflict. Sam quits his job, but why?  What's the driving force behind his decision? What are his hopes and fears?  What happens as he struggles to find a new job? 
4. **Give Characters Depth and Quirks:** Go beyond the archetypes.  Develop each character's unique personality traits,  peculiar habits, and personal agendas.
5. **Embrace the Absurd:** Make the events and situations increasingly outlandish and ridiculous.  The warehouse of secrets, the rave, the "Radiant Performance" all have potential for comedy, but they need to be presented with more absurd details and reactions.

**Remember:** The key to great Seinfeld-esque comedy lies in the minutiae of daily life, the quirks of human behavior, and the ability to find humor in the ordinary. 

**Example:**

Instead of just telling us Sam is miserable at his job, we could see him in a meeting, looking bored and stifled. He could be doodling on his notepad, making faces behind his boss's back, or whispering sarcastic comments to his coworker.  The scene could build to a climax where he snaps at his boss over something trivial, then storms out.

By incorporating these changes, your script can become a genuinely funny and memorable Seinfeld-esque episode. Good luck!
